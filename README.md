# Active Noice Cancel
We can create sound on any frequencies using this application. We can convert the sound to it's opposite version and then listen to it or we can listen the original and opposite version at the same time (original from the left speaker and opposite one from the right speaker) to see how the voice cancelling is working on real life.
